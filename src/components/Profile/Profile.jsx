            CNRS is one of the most recognized pro-environmental national NGOs
            in Bangladesh. It was conceptualized in 1993, from Bangladesh Flood
            Action Plan (FAP16) Environmental Study; and the formal journey
            started in 1994. Since formation, CNRS has been active in this field
            and has drawn attention of relevant local, national and
            international actors including government and funding agencies
            through demonstrating innovations in its approaches and producing
            tangible learning outcomes. On behalf of its General Committee, an
            Executive Committee (EC) governs CNRS. CNRS aims to join with others
            in influencing the national development strategy towards directions
            that support sustainable environment in Bangladesh.{" "}
